Forum for discussions about what the next generation of Node.js might look like.

This repository is strictly for discussions about what people think Node.js might look like in the future.

The Node.js project's governing bodies (CTC and TSC) tend to stay out of these discussions and allow those
passionate about discussing these topics to enjoy using this forum.

No particular thread is endorsed by the Node.js project as being part of any roadmap. 
If a discussion reaches a point of maturity, it is expected to end up as a new module, an 
[Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps) or a Pull Request.
